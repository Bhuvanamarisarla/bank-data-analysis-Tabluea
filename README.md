Bank Data analysis
Developed and executed a  project on Bank data Analysis by using tableau . In this Project, a meticulous exploration of financial data was conducted using power bi focusing on various key performance indicators (KPIs).All the extracting, cleaning and Transformation of the data took place in the power query. 
We have used slicers, page navigation, bookmarks, drill through options in order to make the project more dynamic.
This project involved year-wise analysis of loan amounts, detailed statistics on loan grades and sub-grades regarding revolving balances and total payments. A critical comparison between verified and non-verified loan statuses was made, examining total payments for each. State-wise and last credit pull-wise loan status evaluations were performed, offering a nuanced understanding of regional and temporal trends. Additionally, the project delved into the relationship between home ownership and last payment date statistics.The culmination of these analyses resulted in the creation of a dynamic dashboard, consolidating all KPIs. 
The Business needs and our suggestions are as follows:
KPI - 1 : YEAR WISE LOAN AMOUNT STATS
For this kpi we have analysed that the trend in loan amounts increased over the years i.e from 2007 to 20011.Thus concluded that the bank had made a good amount of business in these four years and the bank has the focus on additional offers/benefits with loan for coustomer retention.
KPI - 2 : GRADE AND SUBGRADE WISE REVOLVING BALANCE 
For this kpi we have analysed that grade "B" and sub grade "B3" has the highest revolving balance as compared to the other grades so the bank has to focus on recovering this revolving balence inorder to avoid losses
KPI-3 : TOTAL PAYMENT FOR VERIFIED AND NON VERIFIED STATUS. we have analysed that 41% of customers have not verified their payment method. Banks should assure customers are aware about their payment methods.
KPI-4 : STATE WISE LAST CREDIT PULL DATE
In this kpi we have used a table visualisation in order to show the last credit pull date to the respective State 
KPI-5 : HOME OWNERSHIP vs LAST PAYMENT DATE
For this kpi we have used a bar chart and we analysed by comparing the last payment 
Dates for borrowers with different home ownership status 

CONCLUSION :
This dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for decision-makers within the banking sector, offering actionable insights for strategic planning, risk assessment, and operational enhancements. The use of tableau robust features facilitated a detailed examination of the data, empowering stakeholders with a clear visualization of the bank's performance metrics.
